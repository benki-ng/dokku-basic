# dokku-basic
Starting point for a node.js dokku application

This was made to be a starting point for a dokku server set up with virtual host configuration.

To deploy this to your dokku server do the following:

1. git clone https://github.com/benking32/dokku-basic.git
2. git remote add dokku dokku@<___insert-your-dokku-url-here___>:dokku-basic
3. git push dokku master



If you then need to delete this application, ssh into your dokku server and run: dokku delete dokku-basic
